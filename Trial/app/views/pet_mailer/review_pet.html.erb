      Greetings Review Team the creator <%= @pet.user.vname %> 
      has recently created this new pet that he/she would 
      like to add to our wonderful site. Please take the time
      to review the pet itself very carefully and use
      your best judgment to determine whether this pet
      should be featured here or if it should be revised first.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel that this creator is truly deserving to
      have their pet featured here then please click the
      approve button on the review section. An accept not
      only gives the user some gratitude but also gives
      the user some points to continue their wonderful
      pet creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel that the creator's pet is just not up
      to snuff yet or features inappropriate content
      then please click the deny button from the review
      section. As members of this special team please
      do not abuse your powers for evil purposes, that
      is all.
