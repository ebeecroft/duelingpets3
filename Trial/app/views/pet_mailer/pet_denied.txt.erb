Your pet <%= @pet.species_name %> was not approved.
===============================================
 
The reason that this pet was denied access onto
the site was either because the pet image itself was
empty, or the pet was found to be inappropriate.

If you can revise the pet that was just sent
then maybe it will be able to be approved the next
time around. Its no big deal and the review team
would be happy to point into the right direction
for your pet to be processed.
