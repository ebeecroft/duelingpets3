      Greetings Review Team the annoucer <%= @sound.user.vname %> 
      has recently created a new song, voice or sound effect that
      he/she would like to add to our wonderful site. Please
      take the time to review the audio itself very carefully
      and use your best judgment to determine whether this
      audio should be featured here or if it should be
      revised first.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel that this annoucer is truly deserving to
      have their audio featured here then please click the
      approve button on the review section. An accept not
      only gives the user some gratitude but also gives
      the user some points to continue their wonderful
      audio projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel that the annoucer's audio is just not up
      to snuff yet or features inappropriate content
      then please click the deny button from the review
      section. As members of this special team please
      do not abuse your powers for evil purposes, that
      is all.
