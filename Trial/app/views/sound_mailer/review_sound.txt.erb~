Greetings Review Team the annoucer <%= @sound.user.vname %> 
has recently created a new song, voice or sound effect that
he/she would like to add to our wonderful site. Please
take the time to review the audio itself very carefully
and use your best judgment to determine whether this
audio should be featured here or if it should be
revised first.

If you feel that this annoucer is truly deserving to
have their audio featured here then please click the
approve button on the review section. An accept not
only gives the user some gratitude but also gives
the user some points to continue their wonderful
audio projects.
 
If you feel that the annoucer's audio is just not up
to snuff yet or features inappropriate content
then please click the deny button from the review
section. As members of this special team please
do not abuse your powers for evil purposes, that
is all.
