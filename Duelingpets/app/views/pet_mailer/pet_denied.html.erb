    <h1>Your pet <%= @pet.species_name %> was not approved.</h1>
    <p>
      The reason that this pet was denied access onto
      the site was either because the pet image itself was
      empty, or the pet was found to be inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can revise the pet that was just sent
      then maybe it will be able to be approved the next
      time around. Its no big deal and the review team
      would be happy to point into the right direction
      for your pet to be processed.
    </p>
    <p>
