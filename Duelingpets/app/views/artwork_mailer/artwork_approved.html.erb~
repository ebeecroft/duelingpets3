    <h1>The artwork <%= @artwork.title %> was not approved.</h1>
    <p>
      The reason that this artwork was denied access onto
      the site was either because the artwork itself was
      empty, or the artwork was found to be inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can revise the artwork that was just sent
      then maybe it will be able to be approved the next
      time around. Its no big deal and the review team
      would be happy to point into the right direction
      for your artwork to be processed.
